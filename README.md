* Basic Sound playback and layered music system using FMOD Ex's horrible .NET bindings
* Basic GUI, including a base control class and basic controls including Bars, Buttons, Icons, Labels and Windows to encapsulate them

* Originally I also started working on a TileEd renderer/parser, but didn't end up needing it for any of my ideas so I never finished it
